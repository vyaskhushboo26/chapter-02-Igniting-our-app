## Summary of today's class:

Igniting React App
. In last class - Created Basic React App

. Today, production ready React App - From scratch without using create react-app

. to Ignite our app - Bundler eg : vite,parcel,webpack

. In create react-app, they use webpack bundler

. Bundler is package/module of javascript code

. All the package that my project need is a dev depandency 
  and parcel is such of one dependency

. to have a package in code -> we need Package Manager (eg : npm, yarn)

npm init -> create package.json -> which is amezing configuration, which npm needs to run it self.
npm init -y -> to skip configuration

. why npm ? helper packages -> Because react app cant be whole full fleject production app, we need lots of super power or packages to minified, bundle it, optimizied, tree shaking, chunk in or lots of things and using NPM( package manager ) we can insall these packages in our project. 

Parcel :

npm install -D parcel  -> -D dev dependency
      or
npm install --save-dev parcel

parcel comes as a dev dependencies because we need it at our dev enviroment and also
their will be some packages that we need at our globle enviroment that we will installed
it without '-D'

1. created package-lock.json
    -> and it'll exectly tell you that what version your project depend on. 
    -> we need package-lock.json file in GIT throught this we can regenerate Node Module. 

2. created Node modules
   -> never put Node Module in GIT 
   -> Node Module is a helper function / helper code

step 2
  
react cdn - is not a good way Good way -> in server thrugh node modules

npm install react -> in global dependencies not dev dependencies

npm install react-dom -> in globle dependencies

npx parcel index.html -> Execute using npm with index.html as entry point -> Creates local server

Parcel gives us this server

Error : React is defined because we removed cdn link. Instead of that, we have to use import since this time we are using node modules - npm 

Error : Browser doesnot understand import -> we have to inform its modules, use type="module" in script tag
Note : Module can import and export

Warning : React DOM -> createRoot is not found -> use react-dom/client

Live Server -> Auto refresh -> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) -> Parcel does it for us using File Watcher Algorithm (written in c++) Parcel.cache -> uses this space for doing all the HMR, minify and other stuffs dist folder -> minified code in dist npx parcel build index.html -> production ready build is created by parcel inside dist folder and has only 3 files : css, html and js file containing all the code including react code

Parcel Functionalities :

1. HMR - Hot Module Replacement
2. File Watcher algorithm -> written c++
3. Bundling
4. minification (removing indentation)
5. Cleaning our code
6. Dist -> npm parcel build index.html
7. Manager Dev and Producion Build
8. Super fast Build algorithm
9. Image optimization
10. caching while development
11. Compression
12. works with older version of browsers
13. Https on dev as well 
npx parcel index.html --https 
14. Consistent Hashing Algorithm 
15. zero config bundler
16. Manager port number 
17. Tree shaking - Removing unwanted code
18. Created a server

Note ---> we should put .parcel-cache in gitignore -> anything which can be autogenerated in server can be put in gitignore

Initial dev build -> longer time (500ms) -> for next build -> takes less time 5ms using caching

When using parcel, we give entry point in command so we can remove main: app.js from package.json

Transitive dependencies -> dependencies of dependencies Eg: Our App is dependent on Parcel which is again dependent on other dependencies (dependency Tree)

browsersList -> cross browser compatibility for older versions of browsers

Summary Steps :

npm init
npm install -D parcel
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npx parcel index.html or npx parcel build index.html
import React from 'react'; in App.js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; in App.js
use type="module" for index.html
Remove main : app.js from package.json
Write browserslist in package.json
"browsersList" : [ "last 2 versions"]

Homework :

Read Parcel Documentation
Types of script in script tage in html
